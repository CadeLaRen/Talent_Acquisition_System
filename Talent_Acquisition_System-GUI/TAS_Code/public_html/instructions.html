                            and so do the results of this test. The minimum time after which changes have been noted
                            is 4 weeks. To have this historical data at your fingertips showing your evolutions as a person
                            is very significant indeed. Thus, our insistence on registration.

                            is better if the test is not given in a hurry or when mind is set on other things. It may affect your
                            results.

                            There is no YES/NO type of answer that you have to give.

                            You should answer the way you would in real life, instead of thinking how others would do or how you would be

                            The purpose of this test is to analyze how you think, perceive and react to simulations
                            from the real world. Although generically accurate, it is highly advised not to lock yourself to
                            a certain aspect of any result. This is solely an indication of how the personality type you seem to have 
                            behave in general. Not how "YOU" behave. So take it with a pinch of salt, if you will.
