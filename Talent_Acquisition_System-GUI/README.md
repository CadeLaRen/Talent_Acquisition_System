Psychological Analysis in Virtual Reality

Talent Acquisition System is an interactive environment in which user has to follow a certain “storyline”. During the story, user will encounter “situations”, which are those points in storyline where the user has to make a “choice”. Although there is no right or wrong choice, each choice has a different consequence on the succeeding story. Talent Acquisition System will map each situation to the choice made by a certain user and create a unique “pattern” of same for that user. Then it will check the pattern for partial matches against pre-defined patterns. Saved patterns will be accrued from information provided by the work of Carl Jung and Meyers-Briggs Research Data. Also, Talent Acquisition System will intelligently save the resultant pattern and its output into the database, thereby learning on the go. The results will be presented to the user again in another interactive environment where each aspect of the user’s personality can be explored. Then again this output may be used by people wanting to recruit very specific type of people needed to do that special job.

Talent Acquisition System will be developed as a Web app using JSON for backend data exchange and other Web languages for UI, animations and compatibility. Note that Talent Acquisition System will run in any compatible browser without the need of an Internet connection.
